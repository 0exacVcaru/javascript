But what is Fallout 4 actually about? The game is set in a post-nuclear war world, where you play as a survivor of Vault 111, a cryogenic facility that preserved you and your family for over 200 years. You emerge into the wasteland of Boston, Massachusetts, where you have to explore, scavenge, craft, fight and survive. You also have to find your son, who was kidnapped by a mysterious organization while you were frozen.
 
Fallout 4 is a massive open-world game that offers you a lot of freedom and choice. You can customize your character's appearance, skills, perks and equipment. You can build and manage settlements, where you can recruit and assign settlers, provide them with resources and defenses, and trade with other factions. You can join and influence different groups, such as the Minutemen, the Brotherhood of Steel, the Railroad and the Institute. You can also interact with various companions, who have their own personalities, quests and opinions.
 
Fallout 4 has received mostly positive reviews from critics and players alike. It has been praised for its rich and immersive world, its engaging gameplay mechanics, its diverse and memorable characters, its branching storylines and its modding support. However, it has also been criticized for its technical issues, such as bugs, glitches and frame rate drops. Some reviewers also felt that the game lacked innovation and polish compared to previous titles in the series.
